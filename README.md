# Py_Autorename
To Fuck the encrypt software, something is needed to bypass encryption policy.

The only thing this project do, is rename file with a suffix.

HOWTO

Define suffix = '_' 

Run rename.py, all files in current fold will rename with a suffix _

Current folder range recursive rename

eg. Fuck.doc-> Fuck.doc_

And the Derename.py undo the rename job.

Make Fuck.doc_ back to Fuck.doc

Hope it useful. And fuck the the encrypt software again and again.
